# ToDo & ideas


- SVG editing capabilities

- Low Code components for Flutter, Angular, React (Similar to https://github.com/KlausSchaefers/vue-low-code)

- Improved user task management during test

- Ai to predict click and mouse heat maps or other UX KPIs based on the visual design.

- DesignSystem like in figma with sahred styles
## CSS Render
 - dnd (x)
 - tools (x)
 - add (*)
 - grid (X)
 - Select resize (X)
 - screen resize (X)
 - lines also with reize and mvoe (X)
 - replicate
 - distribute
 - themes adding
 - group move
 - master screens
 - properties live update
 - undo screen does not update grid
 - partial rendering to clean up DND and Resize End code
 - Filter mouse wheel events to prevent jumping back and forth and adopt snapp point acoording to grid (at leats50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300)
 - GridAndRuler should in case of Grid calculate the real position (distance and label)
  - Grid and ruler could somehow get snapp positon also from source model ()

## Nice to have
   - Improve render factory so we pass the scale as paramter to createWidgetHTML()
  - improve grid crispyness. Maybe render in higher resolution and shring backgroudnSize?
