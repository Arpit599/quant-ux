            Quant-UX can overlay the design with a click heatmap, so you can better understand how the users
            have interacted with your prototype. To see the heatmaps, you must first run a couple of
            test with <strong>real users</strong>. Afterwards you can open the Heapmaps tab in the prototype overview page
            and click on a heatmap to open the Analytic Canvas.

                    Click heat maps visualize where the users have clicked. The more the users 
                    click on a certain area, the hotter (more reddish) the area gets. Thus, the 
                    elements in the area are likely important for the user.

                    When you review click heat maps, you should analyze them in the context of your
                    uses cases. Before you created the interface, you identified and 
                    prioritized user tasks and designed the interface accordingly. The primary 
                    elements should be easy to find and you expect them to be used a lot.
                    <br>
                    If the primary elements are hot your hypothesis was most likely right 
                    and the users behave as you expected. If the primary elements are cold, 
                    this usually indicates a problem. The users might not be able to 
                    find the elements or do not want to use the function.
                    Unexpected hot areas indicate that the users behave differently than you thought.

                    Cursor heat maps work different than click heat maps. The longer the cursor 
                    is over a certain screen estate, the hotter it gets. Research shows some 
                    correlation between the cursor movement and eye gaze. This means long hover 
                    times over a specific area can indicate strong user interest, but it can also mean 
                    that the user simply didn’t move the mouse.

                    Often you these hepatmaps are the reuslt of a “reading pattern”, which often takes 
                    ans F shaped form.
